But you need to be able to read and understand Chinese which came in Simplified or Traditional.

There is an oversea website where you can buy the topup serial.\n\nI recommend Taiwan version. However you need to pay a speed booster program monthly and they could boost up Taiwan connection (\u670d\u52a1\u5668\uff09then you connect to Taiwan connection by searching Chinese game name. Make sure it\u2019s \u53f0\u670d not new version one as got two. You need to make an game account too for GuJian online TW.\n\nhttps://www.fnjiasu.com/ = connection program.\nhttps://gj.gameflier.com/ = here to register account and download the launcher\n\nYou need connection program and connect TW server first as above then use gameflier launcher to download.\n\nThere will be 12 parts about 50+ GB. Follow by another 5GB of updates.\n\nThe launcher have a topup time to pay at TOP. You may use mycard 500 lesser or more. To pay for time. You can also exchange for tongbao for ingame shop glamours. Which is not required. Open world is big enough to explore and collections.\n\nhttp://www.changyoucard.com/goods-401.html\n\nYou can buy 300 mycard from above. They will send you serial and code to enter in gujian tw payment. It can be found in Changyoucard user cp products or your email.\n\nEnter both codes in gujian tw after you select gujian online and 300 points for time.\n\nFor tw server you can play for free until 15 levels before u buy topup time.\n\nThere are other mycard points to choose too.\n\nYou need to have enough Chinese language to understand the game as u can chat with Tw gamers.

You're barely alive from a shipwreck, and you are slowly progressing your character.\nThe graphics aren't the fanciest compared to Diablo 3.

Not advertising anything, I found this out when enquiring a steam carouseller who purchase a game by logging into my account, I can actually continue to purchase games through the cheaper region using steam credits since it only checks for the correct region credit card, but steam credits is universal. It doesn't trace your IP for buying from another region store.\n\nA steam carouseller who logs in to your account to purchase a game, will take a commission for every game. Say the lowest currency conversion is about $30 SGD for a game that cost $60 in SG store, he will give a price of $40 for the game. If you keep with the same region, and purchase cheap steam credits at a cheap currency rate, you save even more."},

The company once went on hiatus, and it is only recently that the company seems to be revived. With this resurrection, a new series of games are slated to be launched. Before this, I was actually waiting for Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg to release a world war two HBO miniseries regarding the Mighty Eighth, but years have passed without avail.

{"post_topic": "HP Reverb G2 Virtual Reality Headset", "user": "fantasyrulz", "contents": "**********REVIEW**********\nFirst impression of the build quality and package is top notch\nas, everything feels well build.\n\n[SETUP]\nG2 uses Windows Mixed Reality as its Platform and its really very fustrating to setup at first\nas WMR is only available in Windows 10 and the drivers for the G2 can only be installed via Windows Update,\nif your windows 10 version is not the latest, you have to reinstall windows 10 to the latest version and reupdate \nall windows update for windows to install the drivers for G2. Just this step took me at least 2 or 3 hours to figure out.\n\nIncompatible with X570 and various other MOBO USB Ports, this is the MOST fustrating part! After i finally get windows\nto install the drivers for my G2 comes the USB port issue, my MOBO back panel USB C and USB A 3 all cant detect my G2 and only\nthe front USB 3 can detect my G2.\n\nNext comes installing SteamVR to play Steam VR games and now comes my second part of my headache, its super buggy.\nOnce i start SteamVR, it just crash or serious frame drop or video flipped upside down what cause the issue? another few hours trying\nto diagnose this issue. 1 whole day gone trying to figure out how to run my G2.\n\nSo finally is it working fine? NOPE! issues like audio cut off game crashing, 180 degree flipped upside down videos\netc etc while in game. Its literally unplayable at this point SteamVR is unusable. Second day comes and finally\nfigured out its the USB issue and can only be fix by getting a seperate USB 3.0/USB C PCIE Expansion card that with SATA power supplied to it.\nSO OK THEN ANOTHER WAIT THEN, Ok 2 weeks later finally delivered my Startech PCIE USB card.\n\n[COMFORT]\nComfort because of the cushion is really good but if you got a wider head shape the headset might be abit\ntight at the faceplate other then that i got no complain\n\n[VISUAL]\nG2 visual is simply stunning, vabriant color, 2160x2160 resolution per eye, good black level, minimum screen-door effect 90hertz refresh rate..\nsimply the BEST looking headset i ever seen, no god ray, no mura, manual adjustable IPD (How wide the 2 different lens are apart to give \nyou the best Sweet Spot), you will be lost in VR if you can run it with a beast PC and even if you dont you can still run the G2 at half the resolution.\n\nThe FOV is not fantastic infact i would say somewhere near PSVR but if you could get your eyes close enough to the lens with \nthe right IPD you could infact increase the FOV and Sweetspot at least by 20% so the perfect fit is very important\nto do that you have to either make your own faceplate or wait for third party faceplate (Taobao seems to have a faceplate for G2) if \nnot your experience of the G2 will be somewhat limited. \n\nThe default faceplate is just too narrow for me and the distance from the lens to my eyes is too far apart that the FOV and Sweet Spot is just bad.\n\n[CONTROLLER]\nCompared to PSVR, this WMR controller is alot alot better, some say that the tracking is bad etc,\nbut to me as long as your light levels are ok then controllers should track just fine. The tracking area is\nnot fantastic but its ok, you can play beat saber no issue half life alyx is also fine.\n\n[AUDIO]\nThe audio is fantastic, it hovers above your ear like speakers and the quality of it is better then using seperate headphone.\nIssue is with the USB connections, in the early part the sound is distorted due to USB issues but after changing to a PCIE USB card\nits alots better.\n\n[SOFTWARE AND GAMES]\nNatively G2 runs on WMR and you need \"STEAMVR for WMR\" to run you steam games and that means\nyour PC have to run both envrioment at the same time and its really inefficient but still if you have the\npatience to set it up, it will work but the problem is with the games. Some games control bindings are just\noff for G2 and you might need to rebind the controls or wait for third party support.\nGames visually looks stunning on G2, playing Half Life Alyx is surreal to say the least.\n\n[FINAL VERDICT]\nIts a fantastic VR Headset but with very bad software support. If G2 is owned by Steam like Valve Index is then \ni would give it a 10/10 but with Windows?

For the price (around 300SGD give or take depending on where you buy from) you get a 144hz curved display, solid build quality (quite impressed with the metal stand), and AMD freesync. \n\nThe color reproduction is also very good. Definitely not the best compared to other monitors but unless you're a photo editor, you definitely won't complain. Colors are vibrant without being washed out. The screen is rated at 115% sRGB. A good display but still nothing super impressive.\n\nThe 144hz refresh rate was definitely the thing I noticed first after booting up. Animations are way smoother and more pleasing coming from a 60hz monitor before. If you play a lot of games and your hardware can push the fps up to 144, you'll definitely be pleased by how smooth everything is.\n\nThe curve is noticeable but doesn't really stand out while I'm using it. Maybe it's just me. A cool feature to have but don't expect some type of 360 degree immersive experience. \n\nOverall, this monitor is a real bang for the buck display from MSI.

{"post_topic": "MSI GeForce RTX 2070 Super Gaming X Review", "user": "Zanderos", "contents": "Hi everyone, I recently purchased MSI's GeForce RTX 2070 Super Gaming X for my PC build and would like to share my experience. \n\nThe case I have is the Fractal Design Meshify C Light TG. \n\nI chose this GPU mainly for its design and cooling. This GPU is hefty for a two fan card, measuring almost 300mm across (297mm to be exact) and 56mm thick. Unfortunately, this meant that I was not able to fit a radiator in the front of my case and had to settle with it at the top as an exhaust.\n\nNevertheless, I really appreciate the heft of the card and the larger heatsinks. With the Twin Frozr thermal design featuring dual Torx Fan, the card is silent but powerful and my GPU temps have stayed below 70 degrees celsius in room temperature on AAA games such as Anthem.\n\nThe dragon logo on the card stands out but may not be for everybody. I do like it compared to cards like EVGA which just has their brand visible.\nThe RGB can be controlled by MSI's Mystic Light or the Dragon Center (which has more functions), the UI on both is pretty straightforward and setting it up has been seamless.\n\nInside the box you will find a supporting bracket for the GPU, it will be attached to the expansion slot below your GPU, taking up a total of 3 slots. \nVery grateful for this as it saved me the hassle of purchasing a separate product to support the GPU to prevent the dreaded bending of PCIE slots. My motherboard, the MSI B450 Tomahawk Max, does have a reinforced slot for the GPU but with this additional support, it really puts my mind at ease.\n\nThe GeForce RTX 2070 Super Gaming X Trio is another good choice that has been heavily reviewed but do take note that it will not fit into the Meshify C. \nThere is another version of this GPU, the GeForce RTX 2070 Super Gaming Z, which has a core clock of 1815MHz. The Gaming X is probably sufficient but if you have spare cash you may want to go for the Gaming Z.\n\nI have not experienced any issues with the card so far, and have been able to run all my games on ultra (1080p MSI MAG241C monitor):\n\nCSGO, 250-300 FPS.\nApex Legends, 140-160 FPS.\nAnthem, 80-100 FPS.\n\nAll in all, MSI has done a great job with the cooling on this card. I would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a 2070 Super. And yes I do have quite a number of their products and may sound a little biased but I honestly ended up with them due to their quality and value.\n\nSome pics of my build:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/XmxZjfc"},

The PCIE slot at the top is reserved for the GPU and is reinforced with metal to prevent bending. Very welcoming especially with the large size and heavy weight of modern GPU.\n\nI have already used up all my PCIE slots, 2 for GPU, 1 for my NZXT controller, 1 for my WiFi card, and 2 for my GPU's supporting bracket (it doesn't actually slot into the PCIE slot but takes up the space at the back).\n\nIt has 2 USB headers, which is already taken up by my NZXT Kraken X52 and Hue 2 Controller. I still need 1 USB header for my WiFi card's Bluetooth which I will most likely be getting a splitter for it.\n\nThe RGB lighting on the motherboard is just some LEDs at the top right corner, you can control it with MSI's Mystic Lighting but I would have preferred something more prominent such as the logo on the mobo.\n\nFor those who are building a similar system with Fractal Design's Meshify C, do take note of your RAM's height if you intend to put an AIO cooler. As my GPU is too long, I could only put the radiator at the top of my case, and due to my RAM's height (G.Skill Trident Neo Z), I had to physically cut a hole in the fans so that it can all fit.\n\nOverall, I am very happy with the MSI B450 Tomahawk MAX, it is reasonably priced and just works without any frills."},

The cash shop items and premium pass will be cosmetic and related rewards. It also claim that anything p2w in the f2p version are completely removed in \"Unchained\".\n\nRelease date\nIt supposedly release on 30-Sept-2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal thoughts\nThis is basically all their claims but all veterans should know that the company has rather bad track records when come to p2w.

However the aesthetic of the lights is sort of limited by the fact that the RGB lights scattered throughout the board are red only and aren't addressable, and honestly better off left disabled. I'd say this motherboard is best paired with a tinted glass window and a healthy amount of extra RGB lights.\n\nConnectivity\nThe ACE has more than enough connectivity options, boasting AC 9560 wifi, a Killer NIC, 4 USB 2.0, 6 USB 3.1 as well as a USB Gen 2 port on the back plate. This isn't including the internal headers, which also include two USB 3.1 Gen2 headers, which while may be overkill to some is a godsend to me. There is, however, a distinct lack of video output, however with a $450 board its not like you'll be pairing it with integrated graphics right?\n\nAudio\nFor audiophiles, it offers a shielded Realtek ALC1220 with ESS Sabre 9018, which is always nice.\n\nConclusion\nThe Z390 MEG ACE is a solid choice for a 9900K, and while it may be lacking in the VRM department compared to other boards in is price point (i.e. Aorus Ultra etc), it's feature list is almost overkill and make it a more competitive choice to simple gamers or those who don't care too much about overclocking but instead cherish visuals and features."},

{"post_topic": "[GAMING MONITOR REVIEW] MSI OPTIX MAG241C", "user": "yeomond", "contents": "Having launched 6 months ago at $469, it has now dropped to a more competitive price of around $330-ish. This puts it around the range of popular monitors from acer and prism plus.\n\nHaving used it for about a week I feel like typing out a review to say why I made the decision out of the other similar monitors. (I spent more than a week prior to buying just on youtube reviews haha)\n\nFirst impressions: the base of the monitor is metal and its damn solid. it even comes with 2 usb ports on it, which is helpful for charging my phone on my desk.\n\nSo the features I got it for were the 144hz freesync and the VA panel. Freesync works with my nvidia 1070 flawlessly, and the fact that its a 1080p screen means i can run current and future games at 100+ refresh rate on max settings comfortably. The colours are vibrant without looking over saturated as well.\n\nOne advantage of this VA panel over IPS panels is that it doesnt suffer from ips corner glow, so in dark games on movies its gonna look good. And the contrast ratio of this VA panel is better than IPS panels as well.\n\nOne flaw I would say is that it has some ghosting which isnt noticeable in games, only on testufo.com . most TN panels have 1ms response time but then again the colours wont be as accurate as this VA panel (MSI has went all out to ensure this monitor has huge SRGB and Adobe RGB coverage)\n\nI chose this over prism in the end because of the MSI's brand, which I believe they would have tested it more extensively. The extra usb ports and headphone stand that it has have been really useful, I wish more manufacturers would include these haha."},

Older gamers like me don't want the fast paced gameplay required for a scout mech - but would fit in with the slower brawlers or support mechs (missile/sniper).\n\nXP allows unlocking of mech upgrades but the improvement is just marginal so you do not really 'level-up' in the game.  Emphasis is for the player to learn skills required 'in real life and real time'.  This virtually removes the 'grind' associated with usual MMO gameplays - which is a big draw for me.\n\nMWO is now in closed beta but you can join it right now if you purchase founders pack.  Trust me that this is game is good.  Since i've gotten access, my 'steam' account as been lonely as i have been playing this game non-stop. \n\nSystem Requirements - officially the specs are not out yet.\n\nWe know that the game uses cry engine 3, so it would be a safe assumption to use the Crysis 2 system specs as a proxy.\n\n* Minimum: 2GHz Core 2 Duo / A64 X2 CPU, 2GB RAM, 8800GT / HD3850, 512MB Video Memory, DX9.0c, Shader Model 3.0, Windows XP, 20fps @ 1024 x 768 \n\n* Recommended: 2.66GHz Core 2 Duo / A64 X2 CPU, 3GB RAM, GTX280 / HD4870, 1GB Video Memory, DX9.0, Shader Model 3.0/4.0, Windows XP, 30fps @ 1650 x 1080 \n\n* Highly Recommended: 3GHz Core i7 4GB RAM, GTX560Ti / HD4870 X2, 1.8GB Video Memory, DX11, Shader Model 3.0/4.0, Windows 7, 30fps @ 1920 x 1200\n\nThere are many die-hard fans that are setting up mech cockpits in anticipation for the game.  This is one of the better ones that i've seen albeit single screen.\n\nFinally, when you have gotten the hang of piloting a 4-storey sized robot packed with high tech weaponry -- it is battlefield tactics and good teamwork that determine whether a lance comes out on top or not."},

I've got over 30h gameplay there and so far I enjoy it, but I never played anything alike. If some of you tried it maybe you can comment on the pluses/minuses of the game? It's still in early access, but does it look promising?

Fallout 1$2 sets high standards, lots of dialogue options and meaningful choices, atmosphere is second to none and the lore is so well written it has become a huge brand. Unfortunately, under Bethesda banner.\n\nMy best all timers would be: PlaneScape: Torment. Shadowrun: Dragonfall and...probably Tyranny. All of these have twisted and well written narratives, combat tactics are decent and replay value is high. I'd add Fallouts here but these games just get too much attention \n\nAnd recent I would have to ask you. The last I played is Tyranny and Pillars of Eternity.

In this test of skill, strategy and teamwork players will band together with up to three friends on a variety of missions, securing supplies as well as survivors to strengthen their camp against the threat of both the dead and the living - by any means necessary.\n\nA New Story Within the World of The Walking Dead. In OVERKILL\u2019s The Walking Dead, players are introduced to Aidan, Maya, Grant and Heather; four people brought together by necessity and the willingness to do whatever it takes to stay alive in a post-apocalyptic world. Inspired by the rich story universe of Robert Kirkman\u2019s original graphic novels, OVERKILL\u2019s The Walking Dead sheds light on some of the events that take place in Washington D.C.\n\nWelcome to the Wasteland of Washington D.C. Explore the capital after the outbreak, and discover what happened. Journey through the districts of the desolate city, and search lost neighborhoods such as Georgetown for loot, supplies and other survivors. Tread lightly, as any noise can be heard by both the dead and the living, and any mistake runs the risk of attracting a horde of walkers.\n\nImprovise, Adapt, Overcome. In a world where everything has stopped working, players will have to make do with what they find. The post-apocalyptic world of The Walking Dead is a harsh place to live in, let alone find things that work. As players loot the city for supplies, they will come to understand that weapons and ammunition are scarce and their condition vary. If not maintained, guns will jam as you pull the trigger, silencers will break, and old sights will challenge your skills as you take aim.\n\nHome Is Where Your Camp Is. You won\u2019t always have to go looking for trouble, it will also find you. Defend your camp against roaming hordes of walkers when they lock on to your camp. Strengthen your defenses, and take on waves of walkers while keeping the other camp members safe.\n\nThink. Fight. Live. Each playable character comes with a unique skill tree, squad role, play style and background story. They all share a common objective, where survival and teamwork is paramount. The action is up-close and intense: take out enemies carefully with silent melee attacks, or go in guns blazing. You need to be able to improvise, as nothing is certain and a horde of walkers will always be right around the corner.\n\nThe Story Continues. Development on OVERKILL\u2019s The Walking Dead will continue after release, offering players new storylines to experience, new places to explore, new weapons to use, and much more. The post-launch campaign is built around OVERKILL Software\u2019s philosophy of constantly evolving a game together with the community. \n\n\nPowered by Unreal Technology. Capturing the dark and moody universe of Robert Kirkman\u2019s The Walking Dead in stunning detail, the Unreal Engine offers players the opportunity to fully immerse themselves in a highly-detailed rendition of The Walking Dead universe. Experience hundreds of horrifying walkers on-screen in a way that will get your heart pounding. \n\nFrom The Makers of PAYDAY. OVERKILL\u2019s The Walking Dead is made by OVERKILL Software, the developers of PAYDAY: The Heist and PAYDAY 2. OVERKILL is a blend of industry veterans, freshly graduated specialists and great partners. Our passion is to create kick-ass cooperative action games together with our community.

{"post_topic": "New Fallout 76 maybe the \"The Last Jedi\" for Bethesda. :(", "user": "Soulhacker", "contents": "Although the official teaser and news released didn't offer much info but base on some \"reliable\" leaks (claim claiming that earlier leaks about Fallout 4 turn out to be correct from same sources) going around so far, the next Fallout game \"Fallout 76\" may become the \"The Last Jedi\" of the Fallout franchise for Bethesda. It may excited some but may also destroy the games for many others and will divide the fanbase, turn the community toxic and eventually cause the decline of the franchise. \n\nThis ish because base on the leaks, the new fallout game will have the following features :\n\n1) Either MMO\\Multiprayer or Co-op survival style gamepray. Either way will require online to pray and not all contents will be do-able by solo.  \n\n2) No more free and fans-made mods. Only official paid mods will be allowed.\n\n3) \"Streamlining\" the RP-ing, NPC dialogues and stats management factors to make gamepray more \"smooth\"  and fast paced shooter game and to accommodate the new \"Co-op\" gamepray. But the game still \"story-focused\" watever that mean.\n\n4) Because of the \"Online\" and \"Co-op\" aspect, the traditional cheat console we used to enjoy in all previous fallout game may not be available in this new game. This will remove the funs in typical Bethesda games for many as the cheat console ish not just to get god mode so simple. \n\nNot sure how many of the above are true, but many claims the sources are reliable enough for fallout fanbase to worry while others claim fanbase are overreacting and ish too early to tell. To moi this ish already a signal that fanbase will be divided regardless. "},

In the months leading up to the release of the xpac, minimal commitment is required but we'll explore heading into beta to try out content.\n\nWho we are looking for:\nAnyone! We would love to build a strong community and attitude is the core trait that we're looking for.\n\nIf you are a competitive player and have attained various achievements in other games, we'd love to work with you! We like skilled players and would love for you to be a part of our core group.\n\nIf you are casual and planning to do a solid push in PVE, we'd love for you to join us too! We're great coaches and enjoy grooming teachable talent to be able to succeed down the line.\n\nIf you are brand new to WoW and would love to endeavour into this new space, we'd like you as well!

This will be an adventure in wich you will face many obstacles and where you will actually see your character evolving into what you have worked for and what you dreamed off.\n\nWhat do we want to accomplish?\n\nFirst, we are here to deliver a true play 2 win mu online server!. What does that means? You wont be able to buy any kind of items for cash - simply no webshop. Our main priority is to balance gameplay between donators vs free users. We also want you to progress based on PvP and PvM wich means that you wont be able to become the best player just by afking or buying VIP statuss, you will need to prove yourself in many ways.\nWe want you to be competitive, to fight for that loot on that boss, to fight for the castle,to make your own team for illusion temple, to make a perfectly balanced party to defeat that one boss that everyone wants to kill. We know how to make this possible, we have the experience for it. So basically, this will not be the usual mu online experience you have seen around, it will be so much more, a long-term, worth investing your time, fun and unique experience.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nUseful Links\nWebsite: www.exmu.sytes.net\nForum: http://exmu.sytes.net/forum\nRegistration: http://exmu.sytes.net/-id-Register.html\nDownloads: http://exmu.sytes.net/-id-Downloads.html\n\nLaunching and Beta Testing\nServer Official Launch Date: 20.12.2017\nOpen Beta Test Available on: 11.15.2017 \n\nBeta Test will be rewarded!\n\n\nIf you have already noticed, or not we have posted only most important information about server here, all detailed information about our mu online server will be posted in our forum during OBT ( Open Beta Test). \n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nVersion: Season 9 Episode 3\nMax Level: 400\nMax Master Level: 420\nMax Stats in total : 32767\nPoints Per Level: 15/17\nAll characters from level 1 with Free 300 Free Stats\nItem Drop : 100%\n\n\nExperience Settings\nNormal Experience: 500x\nMaster Level Experience: 70x\nEvent Experience: 700x\nParty Experience: 600x\n\n\n*HOT* Reset Settings\nReset Level: 400\nMax Resets: 15\nReset Points: 700\nStats after Reset: Yes\nReset Price: 5kk x Reset Count\nReset Rewards: 5 W-Coins\n\nGrand Reset Settings\nGrand Reset: 10Resets\nGrand Reset Reward 1: 1000wCoins x Grand Reset\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nLast Man Standing\nLord Silvester Boss\nLoren Deep Event\nMedusa Event\nSanta Claus Event\nRaklion of Hatchery Event\nMuun System\nParty and Guild Matching\nPandora Mining System\nBonus Event System\nOff-Trade System\nOff-Levelling System\nAuto Party System\nAuto Reconnect System\nGremory Case System\nMu Helper System\nLucky Items System\nGens System and more..."},

Did an analytic review on the GPUs in terms of price and performance, RX VEGA vs Nvidia Pascal\n\nFor the latest new, please visit http://wccftech.com/amd-radeon-rx-vega-64-56-official-slide-performance-specs-price-leak/\n\nAnyway, here is my analysis. \n\n\t                           AMD Vega\t\t\n\t               RX 56\tRX 64\tRX64 Liquid\nPrice\t                $399 \t $499 \t $699 \nPerformance\t10.5\t          12.6\t13.7\nPrice per per    $38.00 \t $39.60 \t $51.02 \n\n\t                              Nvidia\t\t\n\t                \tGTX 1070\tGTX 1080\nPrice \t                   $450 \t $500 \nPerformance Ratio\t\t  0.707317073\t\nTerra flops\t               \t   5.8         8.2\nP/P\t\t              $45.44 \t$35.71 \n\n-As per presentation slide, RX 64 Liquid Cool either matches or exceeds 1080 performance. Let's assume it performs 100% equally to 1080.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n-However the GTX 1080 price ($500) is $ 100 cheaper than RX 64 Liquid ($699). For that performance, GTX 1080 wins.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n- RX 64 ref / limited edition performance ($499) lies between GTX 1080 and GTX 1070. Still, as GTX 1080 also cost $500, GTX 1080 win with better performance.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n- RX 56 is targeted to trade blows with GTX 1070. Things got more interesting. Let's see. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n      - GTX 1070 price is only slightly cheaper than GTX 1080 by $50, $450 per newegg. However the performance of GTX 1070 is only 70% of GTX 1080. Price per performance of GTX 1070 is poor, $45.44\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n    - We can work backwards to find out the winner of the battle between GTX 1070 and RX 56 in terms of performance and price value\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n   - As RX Liquid has teraflops of 13.7, RX56 has only 10.5. Its performance is 76.6% compared to its elder brother, RX64 Liquid.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n    - GTX 1070 performance is well tested since has been released for some time ago. GTX 1070 has teraflops of 5.8 compared to GTX 1080, 8.2 teraflops. It performs at 70.7% compared to GTX 1080.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n   - As GTX 1080 performs equally with RX 64 Liquid, the backward calculations should be approximately correct. RX 56 has performance of 76.6% of RX 64 Liquid is better than GTX 1070, 70% of GTX 1080.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\"   - RX 56 price at $399 is cheaper by $50, compared to GTX 1070 at $450. Winner is RX 56 in terms of performance and price value!!!\n\"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nThose high end gamer looking for best performance, would be best to stick with GTX 1080 or GTX 1080ti at the moment. However if they are looking for GTX 1070 performance, RX 56 has performed exceptionally well, and easily the best pick up ever. Better get RX 56 before stock running out...hmm.. before the miners!!!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOh ya, Please note that the price is in USD!"},

I like the silver aluminum design and the metal texture of SSD220S, which looks really classy.\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nThe drive comes with SATA III 6Gb/s interface, which enables uncompromising transfer speeds of up to 550MB/s to accelerate system boot-up and loading times\n\nMoreover, the SSD220 is engineered with a RAID engine and LDPC (Low-Density Parity Check) coding and a powerful ECC algorithm, in order to keep your data secure. Built-in wear-leveling technology ensures data integrity during transmission, prolonging the lifespan of Transcend\u2019s SSD220.\n\nHere you can see how the SSD220S performs after I installed it to replace the old 3.5-inch hard-drive.\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nThe drive confirms the official 550MB/s and 450MB/s read/write sequential performance figures in the CrystalDiskMark. The read speed was 558.3 megabytes per second, and write speed was 492.6MB/s. This is pretty strong for a budget SATA solid state drive and a lot faster than any mechanical disk, which generally delivers under 170 MB/s.\n\nAs to the gaming performance the SSD220S effects, I can see great improvement from the in game load times, particularly if a game often has pop-in and/or loads/streams a lot of content throughout playing. For example, previously when I played GTA 5, the load time was about 70 seconds, now it only takes 39 seconds. \n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nThe Transcend SSD220S is an affordable and satisfying upgrade for gaming. Even if Transcend SSD isn't the fastest thing on the planet, it's still a huge upgrade from a traditional HDD. It is a great choice for re-booting your system to get a better gaming experience."},

Relentlessly pursued by the authorities, they make a desperate escape, seeking refuge in the city's seamy slums and sunless underground catacombs. On their trail are heavily armed city guards, rival bandit gangs, and a clan of psychotic subterranean cannibals. Can a motley crew of outsiders survive this vicious world without sacrificing their own humanity? \n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\nNahmi and her companions are forced to run and fight for their lives against the elite city guards ordered to capture them. Worse, even the Toran nobility is equipped with the latest in Zodiarc weaponry, and will show no regard for the lives of the thieves they are after. To emerge victorious you will need to use everything at your disposal, and not be afraid to fight dirty, flank, and corner your opponents.\n\nCombat is about much more then planning, however. Your ability to adapt to the unexpected will be tested at every turn. In Children of Zodiarcs, every action (attacks, curses, or even special abilities like stealth) take the form of cards that heroes draw at random from custom decks they carry into combat. Do you save that powerful attack for later, or come up with a new strategy on the fly? As cards are drawn, so is your strategy.\n\nThis is not to say you have no control over luck - Zodiarcs is a game of planning. Outside of combat you will build a deck of cards for each of your heroes. While you will always know WHAT is in your deck, you won\u2019t know WHEN you will get it, making each card draw an opportunity for new strategies to emerge. Make yourself more lucky by crafting better odds for your heroes.\n\nEach hero has their own strengths and weaknesses; Nahmi is quick and deft whereas Brice is reckless and deadly, even to herself. These traits are expressed with symbols etched on Zodiarcs' dice. Your heroes will carry their own set of dice into combat that you roll for each card played. These symbols can vastly affect the outcome of the card. Learn what each hero is capable of to unleash devastating effects upon your enemies.\n\nAs with cards, your chances to get the dice outcome you want is also influenced through customization. Outside of combat, you will craft and equip the dice your heroes bring into combat, effectively stacking the odds in your favor. Want a die with more swords for stronger attacks? Equip it. Don't have one? Craft it using collected loot dice as ingredients in a recipe.\n\nThe ability to build your deck of cards and customize your dice makes combat in Children of Zodiarcs about how well you can adapt to changing situations. It took us months of prototyping to find the perfect balance between tactics and influenced luck, but we put the prototype into the hands of Tactical JRPG fans and they have been excited about what we have to offer.\n\nPositioning Matters\n\nGetting attacked triggers a Counter-Attack, allowing you to still be on the offensive even during the enemy's turn. But watch your back! Exposing your backside opens you up Back-Stabs that cannot be Counter-Attacked and cause greater damage.\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nPlay Your Cards Right\n\nChildren of Zodiarcs was heavily inspired by the tactical gameplay of tabletop card games like Magic: The Gathering.\n\nEach of your heroes has their own deck of cards for battle that you add to throughout the game. In combat you play these cards to perform attacks, use abilities, or cast spells. You can combine the effects of cards to create chain effects. Each card drawn from your deck opens up new tactics, making it a moment of great anticipation; that next card you draw may turn the tide of battle!  \n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nBuild Your Deck of Cards\n\nNew cards are unlocked in Children of Zodiarcs for each hero as they level up, opening new deck strategies with each new card. Children of Zodiarcs has no microtransactions and there are no booster packs purchased with any form of paid currency in or out of the game.\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nBetween each battle, you will need to revisit your deck in the Deck Builder to add or remove cards and craft that deck to match exactly how you want each hero to play. Each hero's collection of cards supports multiple play-styles. Play! Experiment! Share your builds with the world!"},

It combines rich story, like those of the single player Ultimas, with deep and varied multiplayer experiences, like Ultima Online.\n\nPlayers will adventure in an interactive world where their choices have consequences, ethical paradoxes give them pause, and they play a vital part in weaving their own story into the immersive world and lore surrounding them. Play options will include solo, friends only, or open multiplayer via the Selective Multiplayer system. Players can specialize in a wide range of combat and non-combat skills, provided by a robust, classless skill system, and full-featured crafting and housing mechanics.\n\nShroud is crowd funded and that allows the developers to work directly for, and with, the player, versus working for a large publishing corporation. Shroud is also crowd sourced so players can submit Unity compatible content (art, sfx, music, world building, etc). Once submitted content is approved the submitter can choose to be compensated in real or virtual currency.\n\nBuilt using the Unity Game Engine, Shroud of the Avatar will support Win/Mac/Linux for official launch at the end of 2014.

Still in open beta! \n\nOFFICIAL GAMEPLAY:\nPaladins is a team-based first-person shooter that focuses on two teams of five players each competing for combat-based objectives. The game is set in a colorful sci-fi fantasy setting where each player chooses from one of twenty Champions. Each Champion has their own unique weapons, abilities and fighting style. In addition, the Champions can be augmented and customized from a deckbuilding card system. Champions are organized into four different types: Front Line, Damage, Support and Flank. Each Champion has a main weapon, three abilities and an Ultimate ability.\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\nPersonal notes:\nComing from team-based FPS background (UT, TFC, TF2, OW etc), I must say that Paladins is the closest you can get to a MOBA FPS hybrid. I'll inevitably make comparisons to OW because everyone accuses Paladins of being a clone even though the latter was developed first. Either way, I personally find it enjoyable as a standalone game. \n\nPROS: \n- More flexible metas\n- Unlike OW, it's not just counter-classing -- like MOBAs, there are card decks (i.e. specific skill buffs) which you choose before gameplay, and items (i.e. 50% more damage to shields) during gameplay.\n- Thus there's added complexity than simply DPS skill\n- Closer movement physics to TF2 (easy to air strafe). OW feels slow in comparison\n- F2P! And it's not pay-to-win! (currency is used for cosmetic items)\n- Harsher penalties for players dropping out of game (hence more commitment)\n- Champions carry wider range of abilities, thus higher survivability as individuals (healers can also attack, for example)\n\nCONS:\n- Production value (art, sound) not as polished as OW (but it's still in beta)\n- Because it's still in beta, can be buggy but not game-breaking\n- Party size in competitive mode limited to 2 players, so no pub-stomping\n- Not many of your friends will be playing this compared to OW\n\nIt's F2P so give it a try!\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t"},

{"post_topic": "[Official] Online Cloud Pirates (Early Access / Open Beta on 9-Feb-17)", "user": "BusteR", "contents": "Deck out your pirate airship with cutting edge weaponry in Cloud Pirates, an action MMO in which you fire your cannons to crush the enemy in fast-paced aerial battles!\n\nhttps://pirates.my.com/en/about?lang=en_US\n\n\n\n\n\nMy thoughts\nPurchased $9.99 founder pack to gain early access. Account and level will be retained. Few major UI bugs were fixed after yesterday first patch though still in early phase and probably requires weapon balancing, more events, more fluid UI, faster match-up, more in-game settings patches etc later on. This game is similar to World of tanks, much more similar to World of warships if you ask me. For me it is - Relax and blast away for 1hr+ daily with little battle strategy of hide and seek with enemies after a day of hard work!\n\nControls\nW-A-S-D + Shift(vert up), Space(vert down) + 1,2,3 to activate specials + left-mouse to fire and right-mouse to zoom.\n\nGameplay\nGame is pretty grinding compared to WoT and WoS. You grind XP and unlock your weapons, specials etc and you change to higher tier ship via a Tech tree like in WoT. You may enter the battle with a Tier2 ship, you will mostly battle other Tier2 ships, occasionally some Tier3. When you KO-ed in the battle, you are respawned after 12sec countdown and thereafter can return to battle - this is different from WoT and WoS or CS where you have to enter another battle in another vehicle. So far there is no lag in game play though I understand the servers are not in Asia.\n\nGraphics / Sound\nLow PC requirements - I MAX graphics settings on my HD7850 easily. Definitely not as detailed as WoT or WoS and no HD graphics. Sound effect is meh, don't expect realistic explosion sound. If you can deal with Maple story - this is certainly much better!\n\nGame modes\nDeathmatch, Escort and Plunder cargo ship, Capture points. Maybe there are 1 or 2 more but tats about it. There is no ranked battles as of now. Invite into guild/clan system available though no clan-type battles yet but you can form a team of 3-4 to go into battle with your friends.\n\nType of ships\nAs in above videos, there are 'tanker', 'support', 'assault', 'engineer', 'sniper' types of ships. Tankers have high HP and can enter into the heat of battle. Support - you are going to fire at OWN team mates to recoup their shield and HP. Assault is like warrior class and engineer allows you to plant turrets like in GW2. Sniper is like AWP in counter-strike. You can customize your ship flag and hull color etc from treasure maps or store currency.\n\nOther features\nThere is the 'crew' system where you assign crew to ship and when they level up, you gain particular skills beneficial to your ship - Ok Ok similar to WoT. Captain have self talent skills tree for character development - something like in Diablo?? You can also gain random treasure maps during battles if you are lucky, click on them and let the map timer countdown usually > 25 hrs for rare maps and you can in return get free XP, in-game currency, store currency and other stuffs. Optional daily quests and such available after first patch yesterday.\n\nGame population\nNot heavily populated as of now because you need to pay to play unless you gotten 1 of the FREE give-away beta keys from various sites previously - i tink in Nov-Dec 2016. I was kinda of late and I had to purchase a founder pack. Game match-up take ~1 minutes, though some times instantly e.g. 5sec\n\n1 founder friend access to give-away - PRTIAJC5T1 \nHope others will buy and share their access, maybe we can form a EDMW or SG clan."},

There will be no powerups or uber weapons in their cash shop at all.\n\nI just tried their open beta stress test and the graphics is very good for an MMO (max graphics looks nicer than the video above).\n\nThe game is very arcade style, not the traditional WoW like fighting style. And unlike traditional MMO, there's no travelling between towns and city. There's a main city where people gather and form groups and take quests, and thereafter you will be instantly teleported to the quest area. There are instance quests where u form grps and then enter the area, as well as open world quest where you enter the area and just run around with the other players inside who are doing similar quests. Due to this instant teleport system, this game is good for those who wanna just play the game and dont wanna waste time walking here and there to take ! and then go to the NPC to ? again when the quest is done.\n\nIf anyone is interested, we can start together on the 16th.\n\nSome class videos\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},

{"post_topic": "F2P Epic MMORPG Archeage : Revelation launching 10 Dec 2016. Forming HWZ Guild", "user": "cenedra", "contents": "\n\n\nNote: the above is a 2+ year old video, taken back during Alpha.\n\n\nArcheage is a Sandbox MMORPG thats released in NA in Sep 2014. This December, Archeage will be launching its Revelation expansion, and with it they will be launching a brand new server for new players to start the game over from scratch.\n\nI played Archeage back in 2014, and IMO AA is one of the best MMO that came out in recent years. So with the relaunching of the new server, I think its a good time to go back to the game again. Just wanna see if anyone here is interested in playing.\n\nArcheage is a PVP focused MMO, involving mass PVP actions. Here's some videos of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormal gameplay video\n\n\n\n\n\nArcheage is an MMORPG that has no fixed class and no weapons restrictions. You can change ur class anytime u want by visiting an NPC when not in combat. You can choose up to 3 class to use at the same time, and with no equipment restriction, there's alot of fancy combinations you can make. For example you can combine rogue + magery to make a character which can stealth, dual wield daggers and cast mage spells. Or combining Archery with healing class and wearing plate armour to make a tank healer archer. There's a total of 120 class combinations you can make in Archeage, each with its own unique title.\n\nThe game is free to play, with optional subscription mode. The main difference between subscription is the ability to own houses, as well as faster labour points regeneration.\n\nHousing: Archeage has a non instance housing system. You can claim plots of land and build houses on it, but only subscribers can own lands. F2P players cannot own lands, but they can be co-owners. Friends who own houses can set F2P players as co-owners so they can use the house, do farming and everything else an owner can do, with the exception to selling it.\n\nLabour Points: Its an energy which depletes when u do non combat related stuffs, like farming, trade skills etc. F2P has slower LP regeneration, so they wont be able to do as much tradeskills as subscribers. But this does not affect their combat related gameplay at all. \n\nThats about the 2 main points of being a subscriber. Combat wise, there's no difference bewteen sub and F2P, everyone gains access to all classes, weapons, skills etc, it has nothing to do with whether u sub or F2P at all, which is a big plus point as most MMOs will have level/class/skills restrictions for F2P players.\n\nIf anyone is interested, do let me know. We can start the game together on the 10th of Dec. If you're not sure whether you'll like the game, no harm giving it a try since its free. And by playing on 10 Dec, you'll be one of the first to get max level as well since everyone is restarting together.\n\nWe got a main discussion thread in EDMW \nhttp://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/eat-drink-man-woman-16/f2p-epic-mmorpg-archeage-revelation-launching-10-dec-2016-anyone-wanna-play-5509281.html\n\nList of EDMW who's gonna play on the fresh start server on 10 Dec:\n\n\n1.

Prefer blackflag.\n\nCurrently playing UNITY -> UPDATE -> I have completed the Unity game. It is surprisingly SHORT. \nEXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PARTICULAR CHAPTER.\nWORST of the whole franchise. WORST.\n\n- until now of all AC i find ZERO connections to \"be with\" the main character. No feelings.\n\n- quest is only go point to kill/steal then end of story.\n\n- Very DULL and unengaging story line.\n\n- the coding for this chapter is SCREWED and climb walls / hiding controls can seriously make you want to scream sometimes. Even when u want to escape also will screw up end up get DETECTED.\n\nAnd to top it off i  find it dam extremely hard to play STEALTH in Unity. Must massacre/kill one... And i hate to do that PLUS defeats the purpose of being a \"stealthy assassin\".\n\nBut i still play and love the game because I'm a fan and to put in good notes THE SIDE QUEST IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE MAIN STORY LOLOLOL\n\nCant wait to save enough to buy AC Rogue then finally SYNDICATE."},

It is designed around an idea of \"being thrown into the world\". Isolated and lost inside this dream-like world you will explore different interconnected regions in a non-linear fashion. The unsettling environment is a character itself. Every location contains its own theme (story), puzzles and characters that are integral in creating a cohesive lived in world. Throughout the game you will open up new areas, acquire different skill sets, weapons, various items and try to comprehend the sights presented to you. \n\nFeatures:\n-Cohesive \u201clived in\u201d world - Scorn takes place in open-ended world with different interconnected regions. Each region is a maze like structure with various rooms and paths to discover. All the storytelling happens in-game, with no cut-scenes to distract you from the grisly reality of the living, breathing (throbbing, dripping) world you\u2019re in. But keep your eyes open - the game won\u2019t show you any sympathy if you miss something important on your uneasy travels. Everything has a reason and purpose - you just need to work out what it is.\n\n-Full body awareness \u2013 player will experience better immersion being aware of the character\u2019s body and movement. Interaction with the world is realistic - objects are picked up with your hands (instead of just floating in midair), machines and instruments are operated by grabbing the controls etc.\n\n-No HUD - For a greater immersion into the world there is no HUD to assist the player. Everything is implied and indicated through environmental design.\n\n-Inventory and ammo management - is defined and limited. It plays a big role in keeping the player in an even greater state of awareness throughout the whole game. Players will have to think about when to fight and when to take cover and how their actions affect the world around them. Different play styles will be needed to advance.\n\t\t\n\t\tClick to expand...\n\t\n"},

The new user interface will make its debut on Battlefield 4 and will be applied to Battlefield Hardline and the upcoming Battlefield 1.\n\nThe core of the new user interface seems to be to decouple the use of a web browser to find and join games. Instead, players will find and join servers in-game with the new BF4 UI. The way it used to be with all Battlefield games, up until BF3.\n\nThe new BF4 UI will also include a \u201crecommendation engine to suggest maps, modes, and more\u201d, and will make it easier to play and squad up with friends.\n\nAs DICE puts it, \u201cThe new Battlefield user interface is designed to improve the experience of playing with friends and to bring relevant content to your attention.\u201d\n\nLast week during the Battlefield 1 E3 showcase, the game did not have an open web browser on the PC, suggesting that it won\u2019t be launched and managed from the browser with Battlelog like BF4 and BF3.\n\nThe new user interface is currently being tested by a limited group of players and should be added to Battlefield 4 later this Summer.\n\t\t\n\t\tClick to expand...\n\t\n\nhttp://bf4central.com/2016/06/bf4-ui/"},

I use Marchisio and Parolo as cdm, both have really high passing stats (In a 4-2-3-1). CDM's like Ramires are no longer as OP do to their low passing stats.\n\nYour striker's should have +70 pace, high strength, and good finishing. Good finishing is crucial. Look up on Futhead which ones have high finishing.\n\n-For breaking up defenses it depends on the opponent. Passing with L1+X will be crucial, as it sends the passer running, openning up space, be careful to not overuse it as you might become vulnerable at the back. Also don't be afraid to shoot outside the box if your opponent is just waiting for you at the back, you might not score but your opponent will think twice next time of staying just back. He might overcommit next time to block.\nDo not pass at the back when under pressure, don't be afraid of just clearing the ball, you might receive a lot of dumb goals this way. Clearing the ball works wonders, and also relieves the pressure.\n\n-If your opponent is just waiting for counters change your instructions for counter attack, and attacking mentality. This will cause your cb to sit back deep, but you will still be attacking a lot stretching the pitch. If your opponent is pressuring instead, in the quick tactics use high pressure aswell, but stay normal. Only go attacking or ultraattacking if losing.\n\n-Squads with 2 CDM's are a godsend if you are struggling on defense. I recommend using the squad intructions in squad menu before the game. Set the CDM to cut passing lanes and sit back.\nDo not overuse the driven pass. I use it only to pass from the middle to the wings, or near my opponent box if I see a clear oppening for my striker.\nPace is still crucial in the wings. I run 3 CAM's with over 88 pace, and helps a lot. The right stick is your friend to use the most of the pace.\nAnd finally, use L2 (shielding the ball) when you are under pressure. Do it, this has made a huge difference in tough matches. It can also be used to dribble when you get comfortable enough with it.\n\nIn defense, CB with high defense are really important. Pace is not as important, but still try to use CB's with +60 pace, just in case of a wild Doumbia appearing.\nWhile defending try to use your midfield and fullbacks only. Do not touch your CB, just do it if it crucial.\nTeammate contain is crucial (R1), learn how to use it, get comfortable with it.\n\nSorry for any mistakes, again is late, but I really wanted to give some tips. If you have any extra questions just ask.\n\t\t\n\t\n\nHow to DEFEND in FIFA 16\n\n\n\n\nHOW TO EARN COIN BY TRADING?\nMETHOD - SNIPING\n\n\n"},

But this game was never on Greenlight. In fact, I haven\u2019t even paid the $100 \u201cno time wasters fee\u201d to post games to Greenlight. I think Greenlight personally is a great platform for people to get their indie games a lot of exposure and it has done and will continue to make working as an indie game developer a viable career option. And I\u2019d like to apologise if I\u2019ve caused any offense to indie game developers who are struggling to get their games on to steam.

It combines rich story, like those of the single player Ultimas, with deep and varied multiplayer experiences, like Ultima Online.\n\nPlayers will adventure in an interactive world where their choices have consequences, ethical paradoxes give them pause, and they play a vital part in weaving their own story into the immersive world and lore surrounding them. Play options will include solo, friends only, or open multiplayer via the Selective Multiplayer system. Players can specialize in a wide range of combat and non-combat skills, provided by a robust, classless skill system, and full-featured crafting and housing mechanics.\n\nShroud is crowd funded and that allows the developers to work directly for, and with, the player, versus working for a large publishing corporation. Shroud is also crowd sourced so players can submit Unity compatible content (art, sfx, music, world building, etc). Once submitted content is approved the submitter can choose to be compensated in real or virtual currency.\n\nBuilt using the Unity Game Engine, Shroud of the Avatar will support Win/Mac/Linux for official launch at the end of 2014.

The game is the eleventh canonical and final installment in \"Hideo Kojima's Metal Gear series and the fifth within the series' chronology. It serves as a sequel to Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes, and a continuation of the narrative established there, and a prequel to the original Metal Gear game. It carries over the tagline of Tactical Espionage Operations first used in Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker. Set in 1984, the game follows the mercenary leader Punished \"Venom\" Snake as he ventures into Afghanistan and the Angola\u2014Zaire border region to exact revenge on the people who destroyed his forces and came close to killing him during the climax of Ground Zeroes.\n\nTechnical Information:\nDeveloper(s): Kojima Productions\nPublisher(s): Konami\nDirector(s): Hideo Kojima\nProducer(s)\t: Hideo Kojima, Kenichiro Imaizumi\nDesigner(s)\t: Hideo Kojima\nArtist(s): Yoji Shinkawa\nWriter(s): Hideo Kojima, Shuyo Murata, Hidenari Inamura\nComposer(s): Ludvig Forssell, Justin Burnett, Daniel James\nSeries: Metal Gear\nEngine: Fox Engine[4]\nPlatform(s):\t\n- Microsoft Windows (Steam)\n- PlayStation 3\n- PlayStation 4\n- Xbox 360\n- Xbox One\nRelease date(s): September 1, 2015\nGenre(s): Action-adventure, stealth\nMode(s): Single-player, multiplayer\n\nBeginner's Tips:\nPlan and be prepared\nWhen approaching a mission area such as an outpost, village or build-up area, it's a good idea to scout out the enemy guards patrolling the area and the location of the weapons, communications and the routes available. Every mission area presents an interesting \"puzzle\" and the approaches available are endless. Find a high ground and intScope all your enemies as their patrol paths can be very long and they really move around a lot this time. Some soldiers will buddy up and move in pairs while some are stationary manning a weapon.\n\nInterrogation of soldiers\nIt would be a worthwhile effort to CQC soldiers and interrogate them for information. They will reveal other soldiers' location (including those indoors which you can't intScope), elites soldiers (good for extraction priority), resources and weapon/ communications location.\n\nFulton (Extraction) and its usefulness\nExtraction is just a way to get more soldiers/ resources/ materials for your Mother Base. There is no mandatory no. of soldiers that you need to extract, except those mission where the main objective is to extract certain prisoners or soldiers.\nExtraction Costs: (From what I know)\n- Personnal costs 300 GMP (Soldiers will join you and they can work on the developement of your Mother Base)\n- Mortar costs 5000 GMP (Could be used for base defence or sold for 9000 GMP)\n- Emplacement guns costs 5000 GMP (Could be used for base defence or sold for 12000 GMP)\n- Animals (GMP rewards and emblems unlocking)\n\nThe benefits of extraction is that you don't have to deal with those soldiers anymore as if you stun or tranquil them, they will wake up eventually to call HQ. But do be careful when extracting as it will visually alert any soldiers in the sight range and there is a noise factor (I think at least 20 meters).\n\nRepeatable Side-ops\nSome side ops will be repeatable after completing more missions, such as the extraction of prisoners or highly skilled soldiers. I suppose it's a way to grind more soldiers or resources. Only those white side-ops are doable and not all the side ops are repeatable."},
